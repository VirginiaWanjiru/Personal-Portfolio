126761 Virginia Wanjirus Portfolio Assignment report

My portfolio Website is inspired by a Career Woman theme.Not too girly and not too masculine.Just neutral.

The most challenging part of the portfolio creation was to position the content well and deciding what images to include in the portfolio.

To overcome the challenge ,I had to think of what would I like to see when I visit somebody elses portfolio.
